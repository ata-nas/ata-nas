### ðŸ¤” Who am I?!

ðŸš€ **My primary goal is to bring as much business value to everyone I am involved with!**

ðŸ”¥ My name is Atanas Atanasov.

I am a **Blockchain Developer**, but I have also worked on build enterprise products, in the realm of Big Data and Information Management!

I am interested primarily in Backend development, but I do also enjoy Front-end development sometimes. My main interests in my career are the Web3 space, AI, Data Structures and Algorithms, Cybersecurity, High-Performance Coding, Web-based Technologies and Low-level Programming. Also I retain my love and passion for Mathematics, Physics, Finance and Business that I have always had since I was a teenager.

One day, I would love to work with Quantum Computers!
